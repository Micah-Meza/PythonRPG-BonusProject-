# You are Hercules, the greatest of the Greek Heroes! You have been tasked by 
#       King Eurystheus to slay the vicious Nemean Lion, defeat the impossible 
#       nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, and capture the guard dog of the underworldâ€”Cerberus.

# Features:

# As a developer, I want to make at least five commits on GitHub with descriptive messages.
# As a user, I want an engaging story to be told using print() statements.
# As a user, I want Hercules (and each enemy), to have health, attack power, 
#       and a List of attack names saved in a Dictionary.

##########################################################################################################################

# As a user, I want the ability to select Herculesâ€™ attack using a menu prompt.
# As a user, I want the foeâ€™s attack to be chosen at random.
# As a user, I want the results of each attack to be logged in the terminal.

##########################################################################################################################

# As a developer, I want to use an Attack() function that will terminate when 
#       Hercules or an enemyâ€™s health reaches zero.
# As a developer, I want my RunGame() function to call my other functions in 
#       a logical order that will determine game flow.
# As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. 
#       Remember, each function should do just one thing!
